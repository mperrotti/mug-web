## Installing depends
cd to whatever directory this is saved in, then run `./setup.sh`. If that doesn't work, try doing it manually by running `npm install` followed by `bower update`, and finally `grunt build`
Message me on Slack if you have issues.

## Notes
This is a prototype where we can experiement with MUG conversations. The overall design is based on MUG Home redesign work done in 2015.
