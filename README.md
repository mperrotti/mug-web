## Installing depends
cd to whatever directory this is saved in, then run `./setup.sh`. If that doesn't work, try doing it manually by running `npm install` followed by `bower update`, and finally `grunt build`
Message me on Slack if you have issues.

## Notes
This is a prototype for how we're thinking about introducing the rebrand and redesigned apps

## Goals of this page
1. Get users to download the new app
2. Communicate that we've reskinned the web, but have yet to redesign it
